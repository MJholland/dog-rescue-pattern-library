There are three button styles, each for a different purpose.

- The regular button is to be used everywhere a generic button is needed.
- The light button is to be used when the background color it is on is too dark for the ordinary button.
- The em button is to be used when you want the user to notice a certain feature, not to be over used, maybe once or twice on a page, no more.

They scale in size when hovered so the user knows which is being highlighted.
